# SOLID
It is a coding approach that I have been talking about in many trainings since it was first introduced and that I care about. In fact, it includes many disciplines. In a very simple way, I have always managed to explain SOLID principles to my students. Almost all of them still continue to this day to make developments that strictly adhere to this technique.

## Simple Responsibility
An object should have only one responsibility. The most important statement we need to understand here is that a class should not be loaded with different tasks and responsibilities. To put it more clearly, a class or package that contains code for sending mail should be expected to specialize in mail. The content of the package should actually adopt this approach. A package or class that specializes in sending mail should not specialize in printing in the same way. It would be the right approach for all classes in the package to consist of parts that will fulfill the tasks in mail, to include the documentation on this subject, and to diversify the classes according to mail sending protocols. Within a class, there should be enough functions and parameters to send mail, more than that would be incorrect. In short, a class should be responsible for only one task. For example, sending mail. If you think of it as a package, a package approach that specializes in sending mail would be a great approach in terms of maintenance costs and understandability in the future.
